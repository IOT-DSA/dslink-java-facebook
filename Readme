Login Instructions:

To login for the first time, invoke the "login" action of the node "facebook" with any username.
This will create an "Authentication URL" node. Go to the url specified by that node's value, login
 with facebook, and grant the app permissions. You should be redirected to a url that looks
 something like "https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html#access_token=CAAXGppnQBTsBALhZAipi6A84JcAB66ZCWH0vHEWVYdgRESsTAK7u7dWZCUumoKJq1lggTJ9JVZBbthXxlwZAYo5YAOiD4YppjsNCxs02TK337wehhIZBkAIZA75YapqGxuy12o7FCPIqnDo8af3Ym4UQCXD2pDyzxTHcvuPFLXLL3reENkcrWcqum6accsqhUBrq3hiRZCLHNQZDZD&expires_in=5175595".
 Copy the url you are redirected to, and Invoke the "Authorize" action with it, and you're done. 
(This is very clunky and will hopefully be handled by DGLux in the future) 
The "facebook" node should now have several useful actions you can invoke.
 
 On subsequent logins, just invoke the "login" action with the same username you used previously.
